  abstract = {The strength of interactions is crucial to the stability of ecological networks. However, the patterns of interaction strengths in mathematical models of ecosystems have not yet been based upon independent observations of balanced material fluxes. Here we analyse two Antarctic ecosystems for which the interaction strengths are obtained: (1) directly, from independently measured material fluxes, (2) for the complete ecosystem and (3) with a close match between species and `trophic groups'. We analyse the role of recycling, predation and competition and find that ecosystem stability can be estimated by the strengths of the shortest positive and negative predator-prey feedbacks in the network. We show the generality of our explanation with another 21 observed food webs, comparing random-type parameterisations of interaction strengths with empirical ones. Our results show how functional relationships dominate over average-network topology. They make clear that the classic complexity-instability paradox is essentially an artificial interactionstrength result.},

  abstract = {The connectedness of species in a trophic web has long been a key structural characteristic for both theoreticians and empiricists in their understanding of community stability. In the past decades, there has been a shift from focussing on determining the number of interactions to taking into account their relative strengths. The question is: How do the strengths of the interactions determine the stability of a community? Recently, a metric has been proposed which compares the stability of observed communities in terms of the strength of three-\- and two-\-link feedback loops (cycles of interaction strengths). However, it has also been suggested that we do not need to go beyond the pairwise structure of interactions to capture stability. Here, we directly compare the performance of the feedback and pairwise metrics. Using observed food-\- web structures, we show that the pairwise metric does not work as a comparator of stability and is many orders of magnitude away from the actual stability values. We argue that metrics based on pairwise-\-strength information cannot capture the complex organization of strong and weak links in a community, which is essential for system stability.},

  abstract = {To assess which ecosystems are most vulnerable it is necessary to compare the resilience of complex interaction networks in a meaningful way. A fundamental problem for the comparative analysis of ecological stability is that the organisms in ecological networks operate on different time scales. A conventional solution to this problem has been to assume the intraspecific interaction strengths in the dynamical system (and diagonal elements in the community matrix) have the same value, ignoring the time scale differences, and therefore disregarding vital ecological information. In this paper, we consider two methods that have previously been developed to deal with community matrices arising from populations with widely different time scales and which contain differing self-regulation terms (diagonal entries). One approach considers the critical self-regulation in a system by proportionally adjusting the diagonal entries until the tipping point is found. The other is a scaling procedure that translates the intraspecific information on the diagonal on to the off-diagonal entries. We show the relation between the leading eigenvalue of the latter, and the numerical diagonal parameter of the former, which in many ecologically relevant networks is exact. In addition, we show for \$3 \textbackslash times 3\$ scaled competitive systems how the feedback determines whether the leading eigenvalue is real- or complex-valued, which is important for knowing when the scaling procedure remains ecologically sensible. While arising from an ecological setting, this work has wider implications in network theory and linear algebra.},
