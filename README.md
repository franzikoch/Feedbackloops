# Feedbackloops

This package is developed as part of my PhD project on the structure and stability of empirical competition networks. It includes functions to:

1. Translate empirical observations of overgrowth competition in bryozoan assemblages to Jacobian (community) matrices. 

2. Analyse the stability and feedback structure in community matrices.

3. Manipulate the structure of community matrices in order to determine the effect of structure on stability. 

A detailed description of the methods used can be found in the vignettes.
